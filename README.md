Exploratory Data Analysis and Text Mining

1. Understanding of the Data
The dataset consists of structured and unstructured data related to reported issues. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), text mining, and clustering techniques.
Key Observations:
•	The dataset contains multiple categorical, numerical, and free-text fields.
•	Several missing values were identified, particularly in descriptive text columns.
•	Duplicate entries were found and removed to maintain data integrity.
•	Text fields contain a mixture of structured information and free text descriptions that require cleaning and transformation.
Possible Analysis Outcomes:
•	Identification of common failure types reported by customers.
•	Clustering of issue descriptions to find patterns in reported complaints.
•	Extraction of relevant keywords that highlight frequently occurring problems.
•	Classification of complaints into categories (e.g., mechanical failure, electrical issues).
Value Generation for Customers:
•	Improved response times for customer support by categorizing issues efficiently.
•	Identification of frequent failure points for proactive product enhancements.
•	Data-driven recommendations to improve product quality and reliability.
2. Actionable Insights for Stakeholders
Key Findings:
•	Frequent Issues Identified: Certain failure types occur more often than others, highlighting areas where improvements can be made.
•	Common Keywords Extracted: Terms like "failure," "overheating," and "connectivity" were frequently mentioned, pointing to potential product design flaws.
•	Clustering Analysis: Customer complaints were grouped into 5 clusters, providing a clear segmentation of different types of reported issues.


Recommendations:
1.	Product Enhancement:
o	Focus on the most reported failure types to improve product durability.
o	Address specific recurring keywords (e.g., overheating) with design changes.
2.	Customer Support Optimization:
o	Use text mining to automatically categorize complaints, reducing resolution time.
o	Implement a proactive support system that alerts teams to common issues before escalation.
3.	Operational Efficiency:
o	Streamline manufacturing processes by eliminating root causes of common failures.
o	Prioritize high-impact issues based on severity and frequency.

3. Key Learnings and Future Improvements
Learnings:
•	Text mining techniques are effective in structuring unstructured complaint data.
•	Clustering methods help in segmenting issues and identifying major problem areas.
•	Data cleansing is crucial to remove inconsistencies and improve model accuracy.
Future Enhancements:
•	Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) using advanced NLP models for better keyword extraction.
•	Use deep learning-based sentiment analysis to assess customer sentiment towards reported issues.
•	Expand clustering models to refine issue categorization further.
•	Develop a real-time dashboard for tracking failure trends and customer complaints.
